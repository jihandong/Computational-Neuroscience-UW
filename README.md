# Computational-Neuroscience-UW
In the face of AI research results in recent years, this course is outdated, especially for those who already know a lot about neural networks. But these courses still provide a glimpse into how neuroscientists of the past analyzed the brain.

**Module 1: Introduction**. It introduces some biochemical background knowledge of neuroscience, which is only a little deeper than high school biology. It is enough to understand the structure of neurons. Although the knowledge of brain structure is interesting, it is not covered too much in this course.

**Module 2: Neuron Encoding**. The application of convolution in signals and systems. It is interesting to treat functions as infinite-dimensional vectors (Hilbert space?).

**Module 3: Neuron Decoding**. Apply the Bayesian method and Gaussian noise in statistics.

**Module 4: Information Theory.** Entropy is applied to quantify the coding efficiency and information of neurons. KL divergence is a useful tool for comparing random variables.

**Module 5: Ion Channel Models**. The application of differential equations to model the change of current in neurons and the influence of current changes on the firing rate of neurons. The mathematical tools of plane analysis are not familiar to CS students, but they are useful for those who are interested in the topic.

**Module 6: Networks**. The application of stochastic processes to analyze the connection structure of neural networks and the stability of networks. However, the details and formal introduction of these methods are not covered in this course.

**Module 7: Neuron Plasiticity**. The introduction of Hebbian & Oja learning rules to model the self-learning of synapses and the application of gradient descent. The former is a more primitive but inspiring method.

**Module 8: Supervisions & Rewards**. The introduction of feedforward neural networks and reinforcement learning. Finally some modern things, but it is the end of the course, and it is difficult to expect too much from a course that is almost 10 years old.
