# 1 Introduction & Basic Neurobiology
## 1.1 Introduction
There are 3 models to Receptive Fields:
- Descriptive Model (what)
- Mechanics Model (how)
- Interpretive Model (why)

**Receptive Field**: specific properties of a **sensory stimulus** that generate a strong responese from the cell.

## 1.2 Descriptive Model
On-center & Off-surround are actually equal relatively

Some receptive fields are **oriented**.

We can use a filter function to describle a receptive field.

## 1.3 Mechanistic & Interpretive Model
Mechanistic Model describes how the neural system does what we have observed it to do.

How LGN RF become V1 RF?

A simple model:

But Why those oriented RF look like that???

**Efficienc Coding Hypothesis**: Suppose the goal is to represent images *as faithfully and efficiently as possible* using neurons with receptive fields RF1, RF2, ...
> Sparse coding, ICA, Predictive coding

Use linear combination of $RF_i$ *to build any RF we want*, they are the basis.
$I = \Sigma _i k_i RF_i$

Interpretive models can give us insights that may be difficult to derive from strict empirical measurements alone (it's from human wise).

## 1.4 The Electrical Personality of Neurons

Neuron Doctrine:
- ~ is fundamental strucural
- ~ is discrete, not continuous
- info flows from dentrities to the axon via ~

The Idealized Neuron: Spikes (output) from a neuron occur when the *sum of inputs from neighboring neurons reaches a certain threshold*.

Difference of two sides of cell membrane. **Ionic Pump** maintains -70mV inside, **Ionic Channels** only allows specific ions to pass through, so they are *gated*, there are 3 kinds:
- Voltage-gated
- Chemically-gated
- Mechanically-gated

**Sypapse**: Junction between neurons. spike occurs by depolarization and hyperpolarization (positive or negative change), Na+ influx, then K+ outflux.

> Action Potential itself doesn't carry infomations, but the combinations carry it.

Myelin enables *fast long-range spike communication*, it protect the axon and hold the electrical potential. Axon enables *lossless signal propagation*.
